Picoprobe Dual SUMP
===========================================================================

This is a fork of picoprobe. I added a second CDC endpoint as a uart0<->usb bridge so that both uarts can be used from the host.
Then I merged the [SUMP logic analyzer](https://github.com/perexg/picoprobe-sump) and [a cdc_sump.h stub file](https://github.com/PoroCYon/picoprobe-sump)
as in the original repo the file was completely missing. As PoroCYon reported, his cdc_sump.h file isn't good enough but ... it builds.
A part from adapting the CDCs and moving gpio conf from cdc_sump.c to picoprobe_config.h, I didn't change anything both in picoprobe and sump logic.
The project is in standby until someone will fix the sump stuff.
The following is the original README from picoprobe-sump project.

SUMP protocol logic analyzer
===========================================================================

Supported features:
    
- up to 16 probes (gpio 6-21 by default)
- 200kB RAM for samples
- RLE encoding
- test mode (external pattern)
  * probe 0 and 1 - 10Mhz PWM
  * probe 1 and 2 - 1Mhz PWM
  * probe 3 and 4 - 1kHz PWM
  * probe 8 and 9 - 1kHz PWM (swapped levels)
- test pin (gpio 22) - 5Mhz 50%/50% PWM for probe tests (activated only when sampling)
    
Limits:
    
- 50Mhz sampling rate when compiled with the TURBO_200MHZ define (otherwise 31.25Mhz)
- basic triggers are implemented (functional up to 10Mhz - TODO: PIO support)
    
This protocol is supported in sigrok as openbench-logic-sniffer:
    
```
  pulseview --driver=ols:conn=/dev/ttyACM1
    
  sigrok-cli --driver=ols:conn=/dev/ttyACM1 --config samplerate=50Mhz \
             --config pattern=External --samples 256 --channels 0-1
```

Compile:

```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  TURBO_200MHZ=1 PICO_SDK_PATH=/opt/pico-sdk cmake ..
```

Compile RAM code (debug):

```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  TURBO_200MHZ=1 PICO_SDK_PATH=/opt/pico-sdk cmake -DPICO_NO_FLASH=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
    
Misc:
    
- picoprobe reset pin is on gpio 28 (instead 6) now
